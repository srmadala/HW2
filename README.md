# CMPM-121-Homework-1
My scene is a village for animals in the mountains. The base idea for my scene is from Animal Farm the book, though I could not find any mice in the free assets of Unity. I included houses, vehicles, animals, rocks, and trees as objects in my project. I was inspired to make this scene from Animal Farm. I originally wanted to make a cult sacrifice scene but was unable to due to my lack of experience in Unity. The main character of this scene is the pig that is looking at the bus and the rock.

Objects in Scene:

Sheep, Cow, Pig, Goose, Chicken, Bus, Building 1, Building 2, Building 3, Building 4, Building 5, Fir tree, Leaf Tree, Small Automobile, Well, Clothes Hanger, Wood Logs, Large Stone, Rock, Signpost, Bench
